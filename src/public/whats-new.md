## 👨🏻‍💻 Version 1.3.8 Updates - 15 APR 2024

- **Minor Software Changes:** This update has some security enhancements to keep QChat secure and ready to assist you!

## 🛡️ Version 1.3.7 Updates - 12 APR 2024

- **Enhanced Content Safety Measures:** This update introduces significant improvements to our content safety protocols. QChat will now more effectively identify messages that potentially breach our content safety guidelines. Such messages will be flagged with a clear warning. Furthermore, if three messages in a row are flagged for content safety violations, the ongoing conversation will be temporarily locked to prevent the exchange of new messages. We encourage users to make use of the feedback options provided if they encounter any messages that they believe should have been flagged but were not. This helps us continually refine and enhance our content safety measures.

## 🆕 Version 1.3.5 Updates - 5 APR 2024

- **Display Name Context:** Since version 1.3.5, QChat now has access to your Display Name as additional context when responding to you. This enhancement aims to personalise your interaction with QChat further.

## ✨ New Features

- **Copy Chat to Clipboard & Export Documents:** You can now easily copy your chat to the clipboard or export it as a document for your records. These options are available next to the text input bar in the chat interface.
- **Watermarking:** Please note that text copied from QChat has watermarking. It indicates "Text generated by QChat," and for code, it says "Code Language generated by QChat," with the note being commented out. This feature helps identify the source of the information for reference and integrity.

## 🚀 UI and Accessibility Improvements

- Significant UI and accessibility changes have been made to ensure a more user-friendly and inclusive experience for all users. These improvements aim to enhance navigation, readability, and overall interaction with QChat.

## Version 1.0.1 Updates 23 FEB 2024

### 📂 Chat with File & 🔑 Important Note

- **Chat with File (Updated Instructions):** The "Chat with file" feature allows you to upload documents directly into your chat for version 1.0.1. Please select the document icon, choose your file, click 'Upload', and ensure you complete the upload process before sending your message. This feature supports uploading files to existing chats, enabling multiple file interactions within a single chat session. Citations within responses are visible, and you can click on them for related context.

- **Important Note:** A new **Sensitivity Selector** has been introduced to help categorise the sensitivity of the information in your documents. Despite this feature, remember that Protected Information should not be uploaded at any time.

Stay updated with QChat for more features and enhancements designed to make your experience as efficient and helpful as possible.
