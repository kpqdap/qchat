# Understanding facts in QChat: a simple guide ✨

This guide is designed to help you navigate through the occasional inaccuracies you might encounter while using QChat, our friendly writing assistant.

## What are mistakes in QChat? 🤖

Imagine QChat as a keen but sometimes overenthusiastic friend who attempts to fill in gaps in stories or facts, but doesn’t always get it right. These inaccuracies are what we call "mistakes", they are also commonly referred to as "hallucinations".

## Why do mistakes happen? 🧐

QChat absorbs vast amounts of text to predict and generate responses based on patterns. However, it doesn't truly "understand" this information. So, when it tries to provide details without complete data, it might make incorrect guesses. But the remainder of the text is still largely valuable, we can simply let it know the facts to change and we're off to the races.

## Example: mixing up details 📝

If you ask QChat about a scientist named Dr. Emily Stanton, expecting a summary of her work, it might say, "Dr. Emily Stanton, known for her pioneering research in astrophysics, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018."

Here, QChat has made mistakes:

- Dr. Stanton is a marine biologist, not an astrophysicist.
- She hasn’t won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

QChat has "imagined" incorrect details about Dr. Stanton's career.

## How can we improve QChat together? 🛠

### Correcting mistakes

- **Feedback mechanism**: If QChat gets something wrong, you can use the thumbs down icon to indicate a mistake. This action helps us understand where QChat may be going off track.

### Fact-checking ✔️

- **Verify facts**: Always double-check any specific facts or details provided by QChat, especially regarding people, dates, or events.

### Providing clarity 📚

- **Refine and inform**: When you spot a mistake, it's helpful to provide the correct details. For instance, say, "Actually, Dr. Emily Stanton is a marine biologist, not an astrophysicist. Please update the response with the correct information." This direct feedback helps to clarify the request, although QChat won't retrain based on this input directly.

### Continuous learning 🌱

- **Contribute to QChat's improvement**: By pointing out inaccuracies and offering corrections, you're aiding in the ongoing enhancement of QChat's reliability for everyone.

## Adding to the feedback loop: Thumbs up or down 👍👎

Your engagement is crucial. Use the thumbs up and thumbs down icons to evaluate the effectiveness of the replies you receive from QChat. This helps us continuously assess and adjust, ensuring better accuracy and usefulness over time. Remember, while we won't retrain QChat based on individual inputs, your feedback is invaluable for ongoing adjustments and improvements.

## Conclusion: Teamwork with QChat 🌟

QChat aims to be a valuable assistant in your creative and writing endeavors, despite the occasional hiccup. By working together, identifying mistakes, and providing clear feedback, we can all contribute to making QChat a more accurate and helpful tool for everyone.
