# Prompt Guide for Queensland Government

## Introduction 📜

Building upon the foundational principles outlined in the QChat prompt guide, this enhanced guide aims to empower Queensland Government employees to create and refine prompts that maximise the utility of digital platforms like QChat. The guide focuses on clarity, context, and structured communication, ensuring that your interactions are both efficient and meaningful.

## Tips for Good Prompt Creation ✍️

### Be Clear and Specific 🔍

- Begin with a concise explanation of your needs.
- Use definitive language that leaves no room for misinterpretation.
- Example: Instead of saying "Details on the policy," specify "Provide a summary of the Queensland Privacy Policy updates effective January 2023."

### Incorporate Context Thoughtfully 💡

- Furnish brief yet sufficient background information.
- Illustrate the importance and relevance of the prompt in the larger scheme of government operations.
- Example: "Given our department's focus on sustainable development, detail how the proposed Urban Planning Act amendments promote eco-friendly construction practices."

### Significance of a Well-Crafted Prompt 💬

- Ensures responses are aligned with objectives.
- Saves time by reducing the need for further clarification.
- Enhances the effectiveness of decision-making processes through precise information gathering.

## Structuring Your Prompt 🏗️

### Start with a Greeting or Introduction 👋

- A friendly opening can set the tone for a constructive exchange.
- Example: "Hello! As we prepare for the upcoming environmental summit, could you enumerate the key points of Queensland's climate policy?"

### Consider Prompt Order and Explicit Instructions 🛠️

- The sequence and clarity of your prompt can significantly affect the outcome.
- Direct the dialogue by presenting instructions in a logical manner.
- Example: "Please list the steps undertaken by Queensland Government to digitise public services, starting with the most recent initiatives."

### Utilise Follow-up Questions 🔄

- Keep the conversation fluid with pertinent follow-up questions based on prior responses.
- This can unearth additional insights and foster a deeper understanding.
- Example: "You mentioned the adoption of new technologies in public services. Could you expand on the cybersecurity measures implemented to protect user data?"

### Add Variety with Tone and Personality 🎭

- Experiment with different conversational styles to make the interaction more engaging.
- Adjust your tone according to the intended audience and context of the message.
- Example: "Imagine you're a tour guide introducing the wonders of the Great Barrier Reef. How would you describe its ecological significance to a visitor?"

### Provide an "Out" for the Model ↩️

- Offer alternative response options to maintain accuracy.
- This prevents the propagation of potentially incorrect information.
- Example: "If there is no available data on the topic, please direct me to relevant resources or experts within our department."

### Making the Most of QChat's Capacity 📊

- Use QChat's unique capabilities to analyse data, summarise communications, and draft policies.
- Tailor your prompts by including all essential details relevant to your specific request.

## Sample Advanced Prompt 📝

"Good morning! As we're finalising the report on digital inclusivity in Queensland, I require a comprehensive analysis of current online service access statistics by demographic. Please provide a breakdown by age, location, and income level with corresponding usage rates for the past year. Highlight any significant trends or disparities evident in the data. If certain information is not available, suggest alternative metrics that may offer insights into digital inclusivity within the state."
