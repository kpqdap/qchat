# Prompt Guide for Queensland Government

## Introduction 📜

This updated guide builds upon the foundational principles of the QChat prompt guide, aiming to empower Queensland Government employees to craft and refine prompts for optimal effectiveness on digital platforms like QChat. Focus on clarity, context, and structured communication to ensure your interactions are both efficient and meaningful.

## Tips for Good Prompt Creation ✍️

### Be Clear and Specific 🔍

- Start with a clear statement of what you need.
- Use precise language to eliminate ambiguity.
- **Example:** Instead of "Details on the policy," specify "Provide a detailed summary of the Queensland Privacy Policy updates effective January 2023."

### Incorporate Context Thoughtfully 💡

- Include relevant background information to set the stage.
- Explain the significance of your prompt within broader government efforts.
- **Example:** "Given our department's dedication to sustainable development, describe how the Urban Planning Act amendments support eco-friendly building practices."

### Significance of a Well-Crafted Prompt 💬

- Aligns responses with your objectives.
- Reduces the need for follow-up clarifications, saving time.
- Enhances decision-making efficiency with precise and relevant information gathering.

## Structuring Your Prompt 🏗️

### Start with a Greeting or Introduction 👋

- A friendly opening sets a constructive tone for the dialogue.
- **Example:** "Hello! As we gear up for the environmental summit, could you list the key elements of Queensland's climate policy?"

### Consider Prompt Order and Explicit Instructions 🛠️

- The sequence and clarity of your instructions can greatly influence the outcomes.
- Organise your prompts logically to direct the conversation.
- **Example:** "Detail the measures taken by the Queensland Government to digitise public services, beginning with the most recent efforts."

### Utilise Follow-up Questions 🔄

- Engage in a dynamic dialogue with relevant follow-up questions based on prior responses.
- This strategy can unearth deeper insights.
- **Example:** "Regarding the integration of new technologies in public services, can you elaborate on the cybersecurity protocols implemented to safeguard user data?"

### Add Variety with Tone and Personality 🎭

- Employ different tones to make the interaction more lively.
- Tailor your tone to fit the audience and the context of your message.
- **Example:** "Imagine you're introducing the Great Barrier Reef's ecological importance to a tourist. How would you present it?"

### Provide an "Out" for the Model ↩️

- Include alternatives for the model to prevent dissemination of incorrect information.
- **Example:** "If accurate data on this subject is not available, could you direct me to other resources or experts within our department?"

### Advanced Options for Expert Users 🔧

#### Using Delimiters for Structured Instructions

- Organise complex tasks with delimiters like bullet points or numbers for clarity and sequence.
- **Example:**
  1. "First, summarise the latest policy updates."
  2. "Then, outline the implementation timeline for these updates."
  3. "If detailed timelines are unavailable, provide general time frames."

#### Sequential Task Instructions

- Specify tasks in the order they need to be completed for complex enquiries.
- **Example:**
  1. "Start with an analysis of demographic data regarding online service access."
  2. "Identify significant trends and disparities in the data."
  3. "If specific details are missing, suggest alternative metrics for evaluating digital inclusivity."

## Sample Advanced Prompt 📝

"Good morning! In the process of completing our report on digital inclusivity in Queensland, I need a comprehensive analysis of demographic statistics related to online service access, including breakdowns by age, location, and income, along with usage rates over the past year. Please highlight any notable trends or disparities. Where data is lacking, recommend alternative measures that could shed light on digital inclusivity across the state."

## How to Review Content and Draft a Response 🕵️‍♂️

When tasked with reviewing content and then drafting a response, here's a structured approach you can take:

1. **Summarise the Content**: Briefly outline the main points or themes of the content you're reviewing. Use delimiters if necessary to organise your summary.

   - **Example:** "The article discusses three major themes: sustainability in urban planning, technological innovation in public services, and cybersecurity measures. Each theme is explored in the context of recent Queensland Government initiatives."

2. **Drafting a Response**: After summarising, draft a response that addresses any specific queries, comments, or tasks related to the email.

   - **Example:** "In response to the email's query about our department's focus areas, based on the article, we should emphasise our commitment to sustainability, our progress in digitising public services, and our stringent cybersecurity protocols to safeguard user data."

### Example Task 📝

"Please review the below article and then draft a response to this email:

---article---
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
---end of article---

---email---
Curabitur lobortis nisl a enim congue semper.
---end of email---

**Response Drafting Instructions:**

1. Summarise the key points of the article.
2. Based on the article's content, draft a reply to the email that addresses the main concern or query."
