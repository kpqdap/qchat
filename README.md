## QChat - Queensland Government AI Chat Accelerator

Welcome to the QChat README. This repository hosts the code for QChat, an AI-driven chat application tailored for Queensland Government agencies, adapted from the open-source Microsoft project, AzureChat. QChat is specifically designed to enhance the Queensland Government's use of Large Language Models.

QChat builds upon the foundational features of the original AzureChat project but is customised to align with the particular operational requirements and standards of the Queensland Government. The application is an integral part of the government's initiative to offer more effective public services through intelligent and responsive digital communication channels.

### Key Adaptations

- Integration with the Queensland Government's datasets and APIs.
- A robust security model in accordance with Queensland Government policies.
- Adapted user interface that reflects the Queensland Government's branding and adheres to accessibility standards.
- Advanced analytics features crafted to extract meaningful insights about user interactions and satisfaction.

### Additional Features

- State-of-the-art natural language processing for accurate and context-aware responses.
- Multi-channel support for integration with various digital interfaces used by the Queensland Government.
- Streamlined automated reporting functionality that aids in compliance and regulatory documentation management.
